# *Security Policy*
*The purpose of this policy is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the dataset and to prevent unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. The policy applies to all users who have access to the dataset or the repository, including employees, contractors, researchers and collaborators.*

> &ensp; — *Vulnerabilities account for the largest portion of attack vectors outside of malware. It is crucial that any software be assessed for vulnerabilities and any vulnerabilities be remediated prior to production deployment. With the previous statement in mind, we iterate that the purpose of this policy is to define software security assessments within. Software assessments are performed to identify potential or realized weaknesses because of inadvertent misconfiguration, weak authentication, insufficient error handling, sensitive information leakage, etc. Discovery and subsequent mitigation of these issue will limit the attack surface of services available both internally and externally as well as satisfy compliance with any relevant policies in place.*
> 
> &ensp; — *Vulnerability disclosure is an area where collaboration between vulnerability reporters, such as security researchers, and project maintainers is particularly important. Both parties need to work together from the moment a potentially harmful security vulnerability is found, right until a vulnerability is disclosed to the world, ideally with a patch available. Typically, when someone lets a maintainer know privately about a security vulnerability, the maintainer develops a fix, validates it, and notifies the users of the project or package. The initial report of a vulnerability is made privately, and the full details are only published once the maintainer has acknowledged the issue, and ideally made remediation's or a patch available, sometimes with a delay to allow more time for the patches to be installed.*

## *Best practices for vulnerability reporters*
*It is good practice to report vulnerabilities privately to maintainers; in our case, through [pedromiguelfilipesimoes@pm.me](mailto:pedromiguelfilipesimoes@pm.me). When possible, as a vulnerability reporter, we recommend you avoid disclosing the vulnerability publicly without giving maintainers a chance to remediate; bypassing the maintainers; disclosing the vulnerability before a fixed version of the code is available; expecting to be compensated for reporting an issue, where no public bounty program exists. Also, it's acceptable for vulnerability reporters to disclose a vulnerability publicly after a period if they have tried to contact the maintainers and not received a response or contacted them and been asked to wait too long to disclose it.*

## *Best practices for maintainers*
*As a maintainer, it is good practice to clearly indicate how and where you want to receive reports for vulnerabilities. If this information is not clearly available, vulnerability reporters do not know how to contact you, and may resort to extracting developer email addresses from git commit histories to try to find an appropriate security contact. This can lead to friction, lost reports, or the publication of unresolved reports. Maintainers should disclose vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Maintainers are also responsible for defining the security requirements and controls for the dataset, such as encryption, access control, backup and recovery. The dataset owner is also responsible for granting and revoking access permissions to the dataset or the repository, and for monitoring and auditing the usage of the dataset.*

*Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, legal action or termination of access to the dataset or the repository. The policy is subject to change at any time by the dataset owner. The users are expected to review and acknowledge the policy periodically and whenever it is updated.*
