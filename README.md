- ***This is a development branch, so it's not recommended to use it in production.***
    > ***If you require a stable version, consider using one of the tags.*** *In the case that there is no valid or available tag(s), you can always use the development branch as your production; however we do not guarantee performance, we can only guarantee functionality and security.*
    <!-- - ****Every file or folder that's surrounded by double underscores is either under construction or not completed ('cause it needs review).*** After all, this is a development branch.*
    - ****Everything is commented;*** nonetheless some comments may be wrong as changes are always comming here. (If you find any error or have a suggestion or question, please let me know through the proper channels.)*
    - ****Also, the organization of the files and folders may change at any time;*** the modules may be split into submodules or merged into one module. They're in constant change. If by any chance you have a suggestion about it, I'm all ears.* -->

<!-- - *On more thing, as you undoubtedly already have noticed ***we provide a package for each module of the library.*** This is because we want to give you the freedom to use only the modules you need. ***However, if you want to use the whole library, you can use the package `turing` which contains all the modules.*** (This is the recommended way to use the library.)*
    - *If a file is not within a folder (that are not yet categorized) will not be included in a module; and therefore, only be available in the complete package.* -->

- *Finally, ***we are not crowding this implementation with multiple models.*** We are keeping it as simple as possible. (We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.)*
    - *All this to say, that ***that doesn't mean we are not going to implement other algorithms; we are just not going to expose them, unless they are requested.****
         - ****If by any chance there's something you'd like us to implement*** (or maybe it's already implemented and you'd like us to expose it), ***please let us know*** by creating an issue. (***We are always open to suggestions.***)*
