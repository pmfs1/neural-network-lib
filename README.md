 - ****Every file or folder that's surrounded by double underscores is either under construction or not completed ('cause it needs review).*** After all, this is a development branch.*
 - ****Everything is commented;*** nonetheless some comments may be wrong as changes are always comming here.*
    - *If you find any error or have a suggestion or question, please let me know.*
    - *The neural networks module is the only complete module, so it's the only that is full commented. It is also the only one with docstrings.*
- ****This is a development branch, so it's not recommended to use it in production.*** (Please take the following into advisement.)*
    - *This branch is not stable, so it may have bugs or errors.*
    - *This branch is not optimized, so it may be slow.*
    - *This branch is not complete, so it may not have all the features.*
    - *This branch is not tested, so it may not work.*
    - *This branch is not documented, so it may be hard to use.*
    - *This branch is not secure, so it may be vulnerable.*
- ***If you want a stable version, consider using one of the tags.*** *As of this moment, or in the case that there is no valid or available tag(s), you can always use the development branch as your production; however we do not guarantee performance, we can only guarantee functionality. (Nonetheless, take into advisement that this is a special case; and that such advice does not invalidate or lessen our previous recommendations.)*
