 - *This is a development branch, so it's not recommended to use it in production.* ***If you require a stable version, consider using one of the tags.*** *In the case that there is no valid or available tag(s), you can always use the development branch as your production; however we do not guarantee performance, we can only guarantee functionality and security.*
   - *Finally, ***we are not crowding this implementation with multiple models.*** We are keeping it as simple as possible.*
      >    - *As an example, regarding the some modules, we are only going to implement and/or expose the most common algorithms:*

      >        - ***Neural Networks*** *(In the case of this module we're not specifiying the implementation as it can be a library in its own.)*

      - *All this to say, that ***that doesn't mean we are not going to implement other algorithms; we are just not going to expose them, unless they are requested.****
        - ****If by any chance there's something you'd like us to implement*** (or maybe it's already implemented and you'd like us to expose it), ***please let us know***. (***We are always open to suggestions.***)*
