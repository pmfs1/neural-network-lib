****turing***, a collection of minimal and clean implementations of machine learning, and statistical algorithms; designed to be lightweight, modular and extensible, making it easy to integrate with other frameworks and tools.*
    > *This is a development branch, so it's not recommended to use it in production.* ***If you require a stable version, consider using one of the tags.*** *In the case that there is no valid or available tag(s), you can always use the development branch as your production; however we do not guarantee performance, we can only guarantee functionality and security.*
