 - *This is a development branch, so it's not recommended to use it in production.* ***If you require a stable version, consider using one of the tags.*** *In the case that there is no valid or available tag(s), you can always use the development branch as your production; however we do not guarantee performance, we can only guarantee functionality and security.*
   - *Finally, ***we are not crowding this implementation with multiple models.*** We are keeping it as simple as possible. (We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.)*
      >    - *As an example, regarding the regression module, we are only going to implement and expose the most common regression algorithms:*
      >        - *Linear Regression;*
      >        - *Locally Weighted Linear Regression;*
      >        - *Normal Equation (The closed form solution of Linear Regression);*
      >        - *Polynomial Regression;*
      >        - *Logistic Regression;*
      >        - *Isotonic Regression.*
      - *All this to say, that ***that doesn't mean we are not going to implement other algorithms; we are just not going to expose them, unless they are requested.****
        - ****If by any chance there's something you'd like us to implement*** (or maybe it's already implemented and you'd like us to expose it), ***please let us know***. (***We are always open to suggestions.***)*
