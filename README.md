- ****This is a development branch, so it's not recommended to use it in production.*** (Please take the following into advisement.)*
    > ***If you require a stable version, consider using one of the tags.*** *As of this moment, or in the case that there is no valid or available tag(s), you can always use the development branch as your production; however we do not guarantee performance, we can only guarantee functionality and security. (Nonetheless, take into advisement that this is a special case; and that such advice does not invalidate or lessen our previous recommendations.)*
    > - ****A release will only be made when the one or more of the module(s) is(are) complete***, stable, optimized, tested, documented, and secure. (This is the only way to guarantee that the library (or such particular module(s)) is(are) production ready.)*
    - ****Every file or folder that's surrounded by double underscores is either under construction or not completed ('cause it needs review).*** After all, this is a development branch.*
    - ****Everything is commented;*** nonetheless some comments may be wrong as changes are always comming here. (If you find any error or have a suggestion or question, please let me know through the proper channels.)*
    - ****Also, the organization of the files and folders may change at any time;*** the modules may be split into submodules or merged into one module. They're in constant change. If by any chance you have a suggestion about it, I'm all ears.*

<!-- - *On more thing, as you undoubtedly already have noticed ***we provide a package for each module of the library.*** This is because we want to give you the freedom to use only the modules you need. ***However, if you want to use the whole library, you can use the package `turing` which contains all the modules.*** (This is the recommended way to use the library.)*
    - *If a file is not within a folder (that are not yet categorized) will not be included in a module; and therefore, only be available in the complete package.* -->

- *Finally, ***we are not crowding this implementation with multiple models.*** We are keeping it as simple as possible. (We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.)*
    <!-- >    - *As an example, regarding the regression module, we are only going to implement and expose the most common regression algorithms:*
    >        - *Linear Regression;*
    >        - *Locally Weighted Linear Regression;*
    >        - *Normal Equation (The closed form solution of Linear Regression);*
    >        - *Polynomial Regression;*
    >        - *Logistic Regression;*
    >        - *Isotonic Regression.* -->
    - *All this to say, that ***that doesn't mean we are not going to implement other algorithms; we are just not going to expose them, unless they are requested.****
         - ****If by any chance there's something you'd like us to implement*** (or maybe it's already implemented and you'd like us to expose it), ***please let us know*** by creating a feature request issue. (***We are always open to suggestions.***)*
