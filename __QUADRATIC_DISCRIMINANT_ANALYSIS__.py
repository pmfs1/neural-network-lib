# QUADRATIC_DISCRIMINANT_ANALYSIS: IMPLEMENTATION OF QUADRATIC DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS. QUADRATIC DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS (QDA) IS A METHOD USED WHEN YOU HAVE A SET OF PREDICTOR VARIABLES AND YOUâ€™D LIKE TO CLASSIFY A RESPONSE VARIABLE INTO TWO OR MORE CLASSES. IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE NON-LINEAR EQUIVALENT TO LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS. QDA ASSUMES THAT EACH CLASS FOLLOWS A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION. THE CLASS-SPECIFIC PRIOR IS SIMPLY THE PROPORTION OF DATA POINTS THAT BELONG TO THE CLASS. THE CLASS-SPECIFIC MEAN VECTOR IS THE AVERAGE OF THE INPUT VARIABLES THAT BELONG TO THE CLASS.
